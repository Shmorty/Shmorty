Hi, I’m @Shmorty and I'm using this space for personal projects and learnings. I'm often learning something new and sometimes I'm off doing other stuff. 

Some of the thinks I've been experimenting with
  - AWS
  - docker/docker-compose
  - Angular/Capacitor
  - Ionic
  - raspberry pi
  - Plex
  - zfs
  - wordpress
  - Swift
  - Linux KVM
